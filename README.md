# API Server

This is the REST server that powers the internal API for the website. This program is responsible for handling sign-ins for the website as well as generating access tokens used by the API. If you are looking for the program that retrieves server statuses, please check out [mcstatus-io/ping-server](https://github.com/mcstatus-io/ping-server) instead.
